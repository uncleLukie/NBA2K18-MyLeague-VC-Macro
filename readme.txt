#NBA 2K18 MyLeague VC Macro#
#1.2 26th September 2017#

This obv doesnt work anymore, ggs!

You can either run the .exe or download autohotkey https://www.autohotkey.com/download/ and run the script yourself.

If you wanna edit pause timings and customise it you will need autohotkey, and edit the .ahk file with your favourite text editor.

Added .pmc file for pulover's macro creator

Usage: 		1. Make the game windowed or windowed fullscreen
		2. Enter mygm/myleague mode but don't enter any saves
		3. Delete all myleague saves
		4. Alt tab/click out of the game to lose focus
		5. Press F3 to start
		6. Make sure you have your controller plugged in to make the simcast live 6x speed
			(you only have to do this once per launch of NBA2K18)
		7. ???
		8. Profit
		9. P.S. To stop the script alt tab out of the game and press F4

Notes: 		This script has no smarts, it is just a series of input sends and pauses.
		That means if your pc is slow in loading, if the 2k servers go down, 
		if the 2k servers are slow in processing your win, or if north korea decides
		to nuke you--the macro will stop working. 
			
		If you notice there are particular times in which the macro will stop working 
		(i.e. in the first game it sims to end but doesnt quit to the myleague screen)
		then check the comments where it says the first game pauses after quitting and
		add more miliseconds.
